# Space

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/menu-space-1.png" class="img-screenshot full-width" />
</p>

The Space components helps to create gaps between components and arranging them at the navigations bars.

Above we have an example where a space is between the logo and the search input.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/menu-space-2.png" class="img-screenshot full-width" />
</p>

And here is an example without the space.

Both stays next to each other.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../images/menu-space-3.png" class="img-screenshot full-width" />
</p>

If you want to align every the components to the right, position a space at the begginng.
