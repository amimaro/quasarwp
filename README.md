> Wordpress theme with Quasar Framework

This is a wordpress theme that has the [Quasar Framework] (https://quasar.dev) incorporated with all its features.

The theme comes with a basic layout, the same way when you install a project using Quasar. However, you lots of customization tools available.

The theme already has some basic blog features, such as sharing buttons and posting comments via dialog.

But a cherry on the cake is that you can include code in Vue.js in your posts and pages. Check out more on the page (https://amimaro.github.io/quasarwp).
